We start blowing alternately in 5 and 4. The most interesting thing happens however in the start of the second
line, which is 3-blow and then 3-draws, one of them with bend.
<br/><br/>
I suggest some rough translation of the text to help you memorizing the tune. It dates back to beginning of XIX century
at least, though due to simplicity no one cared to remember the author.

3rd and 4th lines just repeat the pattern of the 1st and 2nd, though feel free to vary them a bit. The "3/" at the word "drinking"
denotes the bend, i.e. the second line is "G G G A B C E C" on the C-key harp.
