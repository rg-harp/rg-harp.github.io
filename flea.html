Here we need to play both single notes and chords. Let's denote chords
as notes linked with dashes. This tune do not have accompanying words.

It is ok to use "pseudo-words" in your head to keep the rhythm, like
these:<br/><br/>
ta-ra-ram, pam, pam!<br/>
ta-ra-ram, pam, pam!<br/>
ta-ra-ram, pam, tram-pam, tram-ti-tam<br/>
<br><br/>

<pre>
ta-  ra-  ram    pam    pam
6^   5^   4^     (4^)   (4^)

ta-  ra-  ram    pam    pam
6^   5^   4^     (4^)   (4^)

ta-  ra-  ram   pam   tram-  pam    tram- ti-  tam
6^   5^   4^    (4^)    3^   (4^)    3v   (4v) (4v)

tu-  ru-  rum    tum    tum
5v   4v   3v     (3v)   (3v)

tu-  ru-  rum    tum    tum
5v   4v   3v     (3v)   (3v)

tu-  ru-  rum   tum   tum   tum    trum- tu-  tum
5v   4v   3v    (3v)  (3v)  (3v)    4^   (4^) (4^)
