            <h1>Simple tunes for learning to play harmonica</h1>
            <p><b>Mainly for Diatonic (aka "Blues" or "Richter" - with 10 holes)<br/>
            but most tunes are playable on tremolo also (and surely all are good for chromatic).</b></p>

            <p>Start with harmonica, many of us decide "to find tabs for this cool song I like"
                and try to play them. This may lead to frustration as not all tunes are good for beginner.
                Let's try a different approach - we'll make a list of tunes of some traditional,
                some well-known, some kids songs <b>which could be really quickly learned</b>.</p>

            <p>Take few first in direct order, as the corresponding videos have some hints and explanations.
                Anyway they all are simple and could be learned in a few days (all together).
                Learning to play them well is a different thing - but you'll have a time to improve after
                you are basically acquainted with your harmonica.</p>
            
            <p>Don't feel bound to play these tunes "as is" - you can experiment with them as your
            	experience grows - and surely feel free to reuse them to create some music you can call your own!</p>

            <h3>When the Saints go marching in</h3>

                <b>just 5 notes in the in the middle region of your harp</b>!
            	Nevertheless vast field for variations and experiments!

            <h3>Flea Waltz (Flohwalzer)</h3>
            <p>Also called "Dog Waltz" - amusing in its simplicity (6 notes) and still sounding like classic composition -
