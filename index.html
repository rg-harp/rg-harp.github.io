            <h1>Simple tunes for learning to play harmonica</h1>
            <p><b>Mainly for Diatonic (aka "Blues" or "Richter" - with 10 holes)<br/>
            but most tunes are playable on tremolo also (and surely all are good for chromatic).</b></p>

            <p>I am learning to play harmonica myself - and I'm going to put here a list of tunes I practice
            	with explanations so that you can learn and play them too. They are ordered roughly starting
            	from the simplest ones.</p>
            
            <p>Here'll be "tabs" for some of tunes, but mainly we are going to learn with short videos in the
            	following manner:<br/>
            	    <b>1.</b> I'll play the whole tune and perhaps add some words about it<br/>
            	    <b>2.</b> We look in more details how to play the starting phrase<br/>
            	    <b>3.</b> You now have to pick the rest "by ear" for exercise<br/>
            	    <b>4.</b> Few comments on further "extending" the tune.</p>
            
            <p>Don't feel bound to play these tunes "as is" - you can experiment with them as your
            	experience grows - and surely feel free to reuse them to create some music you can call your own!</p>

            <h3>When the Saints go marching in</h3>
            <p>Bright and well-known tune of hymn / spiritual origins - and
                <b>just 5 notes in the in the middle region of your harp</b>!
            	Nevertheless vast field for variations and experiments!
            	<a href="#" class="show-me" data="saints"></a></p>
            <hr/>
            
            <h3>Frere Jacques</h3>
            <p>Infamous French children's song with a pleasant simple tune (7 notes) -
                gives practice on rythm and speed!
                <a href="#" class="show-me" data="frere"></a></p>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Flea Waltz (Flohwalzer)</h3>
            <p>Also called "Dog Waltz" - amusing in its simplicity (6 notes)
                and still sounding like classic composition -
                though actually it is just "arpeggiation" (sequential playing) of
                two chords (C-dur and G7), one blown and another drawn.
