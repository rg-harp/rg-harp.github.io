      <h1>Simple tunes for learning to play harmonica</h1>
      <p><b>This is mainly for Diatonic (aka "blues harp", or "Richter" - generally with 10 holes)<br/>
      but many tunes are suitable for playing on tremolo (and surely all are good for chromatic harmonica).</b></p>

      <p>When we just start learning how to play harmonica, many decide "to find tabs for this or that cool song" and try to study from this specific song.
      Depending on the choice this often leads to frustration, as not all interesting songs have good and easy melody. I suggest trying different approach -
      I collect here a number of tunes of some traditional, some well-known, some kids songs which could be really quickly learned - and allow "smooth learning
      curve". They mainly are not limited to "blues" category (but you may make them sound bluesy).</p>

      <p>Order is less or more increasing in difficulty, though "difficulty" is not good word here. They all are simple and you can learn them in a matter of
        a few days. Learning to play them well is a different thing. Here'll be marks of bends (so one can easily pick tunes to practice bend on this or that hole)
        and by and by I'll add small videos with demonstrating the tunes and some words of their story, where appropriate.</p>
      
      <p>You are not bound to play these tunes "as is" but feel free to experiment with them as your
      experience grows - and surely feel free to reuse them to create some music you can call your own!</p>
      
      <h3>When the Saints go marching in</h3>
      <p>Bright and well-known tune, simple to play in the middle region of your harp. Vast field for variations and experiments!</p>
      
      <h3>Frere Jacques</h3>
      <p>Infamous French children's song with a pleasant simple tune and giving some practice on rythm and speed at the end.</p>

      <h3>Flea Waltz</h3>
      <p>Also called "Dog Waltz" - amusing in its simplicity and still sounding like classic composition - though actually just "arpegiation" of two chords.</p>

      <h3>Sleep you my joy, sleep you well</h3>
      <p>German lullaby of 200+ years old, pleasant tune which allows you practicing bend on 6-th hole.</p>
