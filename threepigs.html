As said, the tune starts with sequence of blows from the 6th to 2nd hole.

<b>Here is a mistake in the video</b> (hope to update it later) - I miscounted these short three-note repeats after the phrase,
(only two of them, not three) and incorrectly told the last of them involves 5th hole - check the right version below:

<pre>
Who's   af-   raid   of   big   bad   Wolf
 6^     5^     4^    3^   2^    5^     4v

Big   Bad   Wolf
3^    5^    4v

Big   Bad   Wolf
3^    4v    4^

... please go on yourself, as an exercise,
it is almost the same as the first part...
