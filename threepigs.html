As said, the tune starts with sequence of blows from the 6th to 2nd hole.

Here is a mistake in video - I miscounted these short three-note repeats after the phrase,
only two of them, not three. Here it goes:

<pre>
Who's   af-   raid   of   big   bad   Wolf
 6^     5^     4^    3^   2^    5^     4v

Big   Bad   Wolf
3^    5^    4v

Big   Bad   Wolf
3^    5v    4^

... please go on yourself, as an exercise,
it is almost the same as the first part...
</pre>
